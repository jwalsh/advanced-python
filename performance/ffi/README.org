* C Extensions and FFI Exercise

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use C extensions and FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to speed up a long-running data processing task in Python. We'll create a C extension that processes a large amount of data generated by the `jot` command and compare the performance with a pure Python implementation.

** Problem:
You have a long-running data processing task that involves generating a large number of random integers using the `jot` command and performing some computations on those integers. Your task is to implement this data processing task in both Python and C, and then use C extensions and FFI to integrate the C implementation with Python for faster execution.

*** Step 1: Implement the data processing task in Python
- Create a Python script named `data_processing.py`.
- Use the `subprocess` module to execute the `jot` command and generate 50,000 random integers.
- Read the generated integers from the command output and store them in a list.
- Perform a simple computation on each integer, such as calculating the square of each number.
- Measure the execution time of the Python implementation.

*** Step 2: Implement the data processing task in C
- Create a C file named `data_processing.c`.
- Implement a C function that takes an array of integers and the size of the array as input.
- Inside the C function, perform the same computation as in the Python implementation (e.g., calculating the square of each number).
- Compile the C file into a shared library using the appropriate compiler flags.

*** Step 3: Create a Python extension using C extensions and FFI
- Create a Python script named `data_processing_extension.py`.
- Use the `cffi` library to define the interface between Python and the C code.
- Load the shared library created in Step 2 using `cffi`.
- Define a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and calls the C function from the shared library.
- Pass the list of integers generated by `jot` to the Python function.
- Measure the execution time of the Python extension.

*** Step 4: Compare the performance
- Run both the Python implementation (`data_processing.py`) and the Python extension (`data_processing_extension.py`).
- Compare the execution times of both implementations.
- Observe the performance improvement achieved by using C extensions and FFI.

** Example usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# data_processing.py
import subprocess
import time

# Generate random integers using jot
jot_output = subprocess.check_output(["jot", "-r", "50000"], universal_newlines=True)
numbers = list(map(int, jot_output.split()))

# Perform computation in Python
start_time = time.time()
squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Python execution time: {end_time - start_time:.5f} seconds")
#+END_SRC
