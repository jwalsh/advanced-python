** Leveraging FFI for Performance-Critical Code
   - Exercise: Identify a performance-critical section of Python code that can benefit from FFI.
   - Monitoring:
     - Baseline: Measure the execution time of the Python code using timing functions or profiling tools.
     - Suggested Improvement: Implement the performance-critical code in a lower-level language (e.g., C or Rust) and use FFI to interface with the Python code, leveraging the performance benefits of the lower-level language.
     - Improvement Demonstration: Re-run the Python code with the FFI-optimized section and compare the execution time with the baseline, showcasing the performance improvement.

   - Exercise: Identify a Python application or script that can benefit from JIT compilation.
   - Monitoring:
     - Baseline: Measure the execution time of the Python code using timing functions or profiling tools.
     - Suggested Improvement: Utilize GraalVM, a high-performance JIT compiler, to compile the Python code to native machine code, potentially improving performance.
     - Improvement Demonstration: Run the Python code with GraalVM and compare the execution time with the baseline, showcasing the performance improvement.

** Optimizing PySpark Jobs
   - Exercise: Identify a PySpark job that exhibits suboptimal performance.
   - Monitoring:
     - Baseline: Measure the execution time, resource utilization, and key metrics (e.g., shuffle read/write, stage duration) of the PySpark job using Spark's monitoring tools or by analyzing the Spark UI.
     - Suggested Improvement: Optimize the PySpark job by considering techniques such as:
       - Repartitioning data to achieve optimal parallelism and reduce data skew.
       - Using broadcast variables for efficient distribution of small datasets.
       - Caching frequently accessed DataFrames or RDDs to avoid redundant computations.
       - Optimizing SQL queries and leveraging Spark's built-in optimizations (e.g., predicate pushdown, column pruning).
     - Improvement Demonstration: Re-run the optimized PySpark job and compare the execution time, resource utilization, and key metrics with the baseline, showcasing the performance improvement.

** Compiling Python to WebAssembly using Wasmer's py2wasm
   - Exercise: Identify a Python program or module that can benefit from being compiled to WebAssembly using Wasmer's py2wasm compiler.
   - Monitoring:
     - Baseline: Measure the execution time of the Python program using the standard Python interpreter.
     - Suggested Improvement: Use Wasmer's py2wasm compiler to convert the Python program to WebAssembly, leveraging the performance benefits of running Python code in a WebAssembly environment without interpreter overhead.
